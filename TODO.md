# Main items on the TODO list for this project

* Check optima for entropy-penalized version using Simon's soft
* UCR file reader for C version
* 1NN classifier for C version
* Theoretic study of whether it would be feasible to derive a kernel from pDTW
* Experimental comparison (using both UCR and Cuturi datasets) with usual DTW metrics and (T)GAK

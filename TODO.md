# Main items on the TODO list for this project

* Theoretic study of whether it would be feasible to derive a kernel from LR-DTW
* L2 normalization instead of L2squared normalization as implemented for now
* Experimental comparison (using both UCR and Cuturi datasets) with usual DTW metrics and (T)GAK (using igrida)
* Normalize x1, x2, x3 by the sum of all three so as to get a uniform meaning of gamma across the matrix?

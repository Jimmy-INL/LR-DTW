# Main items on the TODO list for this project

* Theoretic study of whether it would be feasible to derive a kernel from pDTW
* L2 normalization instead of L2squared normalization as implemented for now
* Experimental comparison (using both UCR and Cuturi datasets) with usual DTW metrics and (T)GAK (using igrida)
